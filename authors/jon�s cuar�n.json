In 2007, it premiered in Venice, and I stopped in London to develop a script with my dad that fell apart, and we started 'Gravity.'",

I was really obsessed with Bergman, the whole world he creates. One that I always quote a lot is 'Autumn Sonata.' When you see women go through issues with their mom, you realize how right and poignant Bergman was.",
