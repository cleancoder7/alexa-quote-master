        "quote": "Pool swimmers are very slim, and they're stronger. Marathon swimmers have to train an awful lot, and they end up losing a bit of muscle mass. So we need to have a bit more fat, though that's not the case with me. Many swimmers have a little bit of extra fat though, so that they can deal with the cold and get through what is an exhausting event.",

Your legs are tired because you've just sprinted for the line, but at the end of the race, when you start to relax, it's your arms that hurt.",
